/*
 * File: CardHoverUI.cs
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Implements CardHoverUI for the card layer of Rail Rumble and supports the playable vertical slice of the project.
 *
 * Attached GameObject:
 * Card UI objects, targeting overlays, gate helpers, or card-related gameplay managers.
 *
 * Main responsibilities:
 * - Provide the runtime behaviour for CardHoverUI within the card system.
 * - Update the owning object state and react to gameplay events during play.
 * - Handle card usage, targeting, hand state, or card-driven map interactions.
 *
 * Inputs:
 * - Inspector references configured in Unity.
 * - Runtime state from connected managers, scene objects, or event callbacks.
 * - Card selections, targeting choices, turn permissions, and player hand data.
 *
 * Outputs or effects:
 * - Changes scene state, gameplay data, or visual feedback in the active match.
 * - Applies card outcomes, targeting results, hand count changes, or card-related restrictions.
 *
 * Authorship or assistance:
 * - Core gameplay design, Unity setup, and project integration were developed by Panjingyu and teammates.
 * - This documentation header was expanded with AI assistance to match the assessment comment standard.
 *
 * Testing notes:
 * - Verify CardHoverUI in the scene or prefab where it is used and confirm the main happy path still works.
 * - Check local mode, AI mode, and online mode if the script participates in shared card flow.
